This MATLAB project applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to multispectral satellite images for dimensionality reduction while preserving essential information. Multispectral images, captured by Earth observation satellites like **Copernicus Sentinel** and **Landsat**, contain multiple spectral bands that aid in land mapping for applications such as **urban planning, water and crop monitoring, and disaster management**. The project involves preprocessing a downloaded multispectral image by visualizing bands, cropping, and concatenating them, followed by implementing PCA **from scratch** (without built-in functions like `pca()` or `svd()`). The covariance matrix is computed, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are extracted, and the image is projected onto principal components. Error analysis is performed by varying the number of retained principal components and measuring **information loss**, leading to a recommended balance between dimensionality reduction and data retention. The implementation is done in MATLAB, utilizing basic matrix operations and visualization techniques to analyze and compare results effectively.
